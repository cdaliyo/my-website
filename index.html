    					<h4>I'm passionate about making a difference.</h4>
    					<p>I started taking Skillcrush classes in January 2020 with the aim of using my new web development skills for both personal and professional projects. My background is in non-profit arts administration, and I am passionate about companies and projects that make the world a better place. I currently live in Oakland, California, with my family and two cats. I belong to a traditional Zimbabwean dance troupe and music ensemble, as well as a German dance club. If you are working to make the world a better place, I'd love to work with you!</p>
